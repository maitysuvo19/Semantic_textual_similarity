# Semantic_textual_similarity
Semantic textual similarity deals with determining how similar two pieces of texts are.
Here, we quantify the similarity between a pair of texts of text1 and text2 columns of the
given data set for each row with 5 different approaches. We represent the similarity
score between a pair of texts with a number lying between 0 and 1 where 0 means no
relation and 1 means high relation.
